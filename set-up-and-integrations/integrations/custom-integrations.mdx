## Overview

To integrate the Minimal AI Agent with your custom webshop or WMS system, we ask for a few API endpoints that allow us to retrieve order and product data, and (optionally) perform certain actions. The endpoints listed here are **examples only** â€” you are free to provide whatever format, structure, or endpoints fit your system. We are flexible and happy to adapt.

<Note>
  Before creating custom API endpoints, first double check if the software your are trying to implement is not already part of our [standard integrations](https://gominimal.ai/dashboard/integrations).
</Note>

## **Retrieving Order Information**

Purpose: the AI Agent must be able to fetch order data based on customer details.

Example endpoint:

```
GET /api/orders
```

Supported query parameters (one per request):

- email (e.g. /api/orders?email=[customer@email.com](mailto:customer@email.com))
- order_number (e.g. /api/orders?order_number=ORD123456)
- name (optional, e.g. /api/orders?name=John Smith)

Example response:

```
[
  {
    "order_number": "ORD123456",
    "email": "customer@email.com",
    "name": "John Smith",
    "items": [
      {
        "product_id": "SKU1234",
        "name": "Product Name",
        "quantity": 1,
        "price": 49.99
      }
    ],
    "status": "shipped",
    "shipping_address": {
      "street": "New Street",
      "city": "Amsterdam",
      "postal_code": "1011AA",
      "country": "NL"
    },
    "created_at": "2025-08-01T10:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

## **Product Descriptions via Feed**

Purpose: the AI Agent needs to access product descriptions and specifications.

What we need:

- A product feed URL (e.g. your Channable export)
- Basic authentication if required (e.g. https://user:password@webshop.com/feed.xml)

## **Real-time Product Information**

Purpose: allow the AI Agent to answer questions about price, availability, and product features.

Example endpoint:

```
POST /api/products
```

Example request body:

```
{
  "product_ids": ["SKU1234", "SKU5678", "SKU9999"]
}
```

Example response:

```
[
  {
    "product_id": "SKU1234",
    "name": "Product Name",
    "price": 49.99,
    "in_stock": true,
    "description": "Full product description"
  },
  {
    "product_id": "SKU5678",
    "name": "Another Product",
    "price": 29.99,
    "in_stock": false,
    "description": "Out of stock item"
  }
]
```

_Note: it's important that product IDs or SKUs are consistent across the feed, order data, and product data._

## **Optional API Actions**

For advanced use cases, the AI Agent can perform actions on behalf of the customer. These are entirely optional and depend on what you want to allow.

Example endpoints:

```
POST /api/orders/order_number/return-label
POST /api/orders/order_number/cancel
PUT /api/orders/order_number/address
```

Example request body for address change:

```
{
  "shipping_address": {
    "street": "New Street",
    "city": "Amsterdam",
    "postal_code": "1011AA",
    "country": "NL"
  }
}
```

## **WMS Integration (optional)**

If your WMS has separate endpoints (for stock levels, warehouse locations, or fulfillment status), the AI Agent can use those too.

Example WMS endpoints:

```
GET /api/warehouse/inventory?product_id=SKU1234
GET /api/warehouse/locations?order_number=ORD123456
GET /api/warehouse/status?order_number=ORD123456
```

These can return things like:

- Real-time inventory by product
- Physical location of the item
- Status within the pick/pack/ship process

As always: structure and naming are up to you.

## **Authentication**

All endpoints should be protected.

We support the following:

- Basic Authentication
- Bearer Tokens
- IP whitelisting (optional)

## Final Notes

The endpoints above are suggestions only. You are free to implement whatever API structure and format works best for your systems. We will adapt to your setup.
