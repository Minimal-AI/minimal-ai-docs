To add webpages to the Agents, insert the URL as an intergration on [Dashboard \> Integrations](https://gominimal.ai/dashboard/integrations). Adding a full website will reduce performance. It's better to add specific URL's that contains information that is useful for support interactions. Our scraper will automatically scrape all pages that start with the URL you add. For example, by adding test.com/faq we will also scrape all it's children (test.com/faq/retourneren, test.com/faq/annuleren, test.com/faq/refunds)

Connected websites are scraped several times a day to make sure information is always up to date.

<Note>
  Never add your homepage URL, e.g. sitright.nl, rather add specific pages that need to be scraped, e.g. sitright.nl/faq\
  \
  Do not add product pages as URL's. The AI Agent will automatically extract product info from your store backend (e.g. Shopify/Woocommerce/Magento) or product feed (Channable) once you connect these to the Agent.
