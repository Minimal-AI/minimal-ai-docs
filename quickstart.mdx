## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Integrate your systems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connect your helpdesk, store and other systems" icon="sunset">
    Navigate to [dashboard \> integrations](https://gominimal.ai/dashboard/integrations) and connect your systems.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Create an AI Agent and write your first protocols

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Install our GitHub app" icon="github">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).

    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Update your site name and colors" icon="palette">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

    1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
    2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
    3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

    <Tip>
      Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference\!
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments\!
